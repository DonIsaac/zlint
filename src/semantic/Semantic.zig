//! semantic analysis of a zig AST.
//!
//! We are intentionally not using Zig's AIR. That format strips away dead
//! code, which may be in the process of being authored. Instead, we perform
//! our own minimalist semantic analysis of an entire zig program.
//!
//! Additionally, we're avoiding an SoA (struct of arrays) format for now. Zig
//! (and many other parsers/analysis tools) use this to great perf advantage.
//! However, it sucks to work with when writing rules. We opt for simplicity to
//! reduce cognitive load and make contributing rules easier.
//!
//! Throughout this file you'll see mentions of a "program". This does not mean
//! an entire linked binary or library; rather it refers to a single parsed
//! file.
